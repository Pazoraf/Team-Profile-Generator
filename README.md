# Team-Profile-Generator


## Description
My intention with this project was to create a command-line application that takes in information, then constructs a HTML webpage. I also employed test driven development during the construction of the project to create clean, workable code in an efficient manner.
Node.js and npm were used during the building of this project. Jest was used for file testing, inquirer for information collection, and file system Node.js was used to construct the HTML page.

The resulting application allows the user to generate a webpage to display information about their team and allows quick access to their contact information (email, github).
